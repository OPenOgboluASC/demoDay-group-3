            <h1 class="title">Why we created BitMine</h1>
            <p class="descriptionText text2">After learning about how blockchain and Bitcoin function we realised 
                that many black and brown folks don't learn about this information hence allowing for the economic 
                gap to increase. Our aim is to educate everyone about how Bitcoin, Bitcoin mining, Blockchain and 
                other aspects of financial literacy and help allow for the gap to be bridged.

                    Bitcoin is a type of digital currency in which a record of transactions is maintained and 
                    new units of currency are generated by the computational solution of mathematical problems, 
                    and which operates independently of a central bank. To further learn about Bitcoin, a link to the 
                    manifesto is provided below.
