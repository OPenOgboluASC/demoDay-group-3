        <h2 class="title">How does interest rate work?</h2>
        <p id="int" class="descriptionText">
                Interest rate is the amount of interest due per period, as a proportion of the amount lent, 
                deposited or borrowed. The total interest on an amount lent or borrowed depends on 
                the principal sum, the interest rate, the compounding frequency, 
                and the length of time over which it is lent, deposited or borrowed. 
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="title">Loans and how they work!</h2>
        <p id="int" class="descriptionText">
                In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations,
                 or other entities to other individuals, organizations etcetera. 
                 The recipient incurs a debt, and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid,
                 and also to repay the principal amount borrowed.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title">Subsidized vs. Unsubsidized!</h2>
            <p id="int" class="descriptionText">
                    Unsubsidized Student Loans are federally guaranteed loans that are available for students who desire to pursue education but lack the financial resources to do so. These loans are not based on financial need. Interest on the unsubsidized student loans starts to accrue as soon as the loan is disbursed to the school. Whereas Subsidized Loans are loans for undergraduate students with financial need, as determined by your cost of attendance minus expected family contribution and other financial aid (such as grants or scholarships). Subsidized Loans do not accrue interest while you are in school at least half-time or during deferment periods.
