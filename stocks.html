            <h2 class="title"> What are Stocks?</h2>
            <p class="descriptionText">
            Stocks are an investment that shows that you own a share/percent in the company that issued the 
            stock. Stocks are how ordinary people invest in some of the most successful companies in the world. 
            For companies, stocks are a way to raise money to fund growth, products and other initiatives.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">What is the benefits of having Stocks?</h2>
            <p class="descriptionText">
                The main benefits of owning Stocks are Investment gain, 
                Dividend income, and Ownership.

                Investment gain:
                Over time, the stock market tends to rise in value, though the prices of individual stocks rise
                and fall daily. Investments in stable companies that can grow tend to make profits for 
                investors. Likewise, investing in many different stocks will help build your wealth by 
                leveraging growth in different sectors of the economy, resulting in a profit even if some of 
                your individual stocks lose value.

                Dividend income:
                Â While not all stocks offer dividends, those that do deliver annual payments to investors. 
                These payments arrive even if the stock has lost value and represents income on top of any 
                profits that come from eventually selling the stock.

                Ownership:
                Shareholders vote on corporate board members and certain business decisions. They also receive 
                annual reports to learn more about the company. Owning stock in the company you work for can be
                a way to express loyalty and tie your personal finances to the success of the business as a 
                whole.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">What are Bonds </h2>
            <p class="descriptionText">
                    A bond is a fixed income instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower
                    (typically corporate or governmental). A bond could be thought of as an I.O.U.(a signed 
                    document acknowledging a debt.) between the lender and borrower that includes the details of
                    the loan and its payments. Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and 
                    sovereign governments to finance projects and operations.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">When is it good to Buy Stocks or Bonds?</h2>
            <p class="descriptionText">
                If you want a constant/reliable flow of cash then Bonds are the better option, 
                but if you want a somewhat high-risk high reward type of income then Stocks are the better thing 
                to invest in. Even though it's best to get a mixture of both Stocks and Bonds.
